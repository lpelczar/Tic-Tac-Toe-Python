# Tic-Tac-Toe-Python

Tic-Tac-Toe game with an AI (Artificial Intelligence) in the object-oriented way 

## User stories

1) There is a 3x3 board, empty at the beginning.

2) Program randomly choose a first player (a human player or a computer player).

3) First player will use a "X" sign, the second player will use a "O" sign.

4) First player put X on empty space.

5) Second player put O on empty space. ...

6) That would be too easy for you :) Let's complicate it a bit by adding AI - computer player should try to predict next human's move and block it!
